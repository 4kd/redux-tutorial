// Tutorial 13 - final-words.js

// There is actually more in Redux and react-redux than we showed to you through this tutorial. For example,
// concerning Redux, you may be interested in bindActionCreators (to produce a hash of action creators
// already bound to dispatch - http://gaearon.github.io/redux/docs/api/bindActionCreators.html).

// We hope that you have now enough keys to understand Flux better and to be able to distinct
// more clearly how flux implementations differs from one another and especially, how Redux stands out ;).

// Where to go from here?

// Official Redux documentation are really awesome and exhaustive so you should not hesitate to
// refer to them from now on: http://gaearon.github.io/redux/

// Have fun with React and Redux!

// TODO
// Before leaving, here is a last example that might give you additional inspiration...
// In this example, we:
// 1) integrate one more great player of the React ecosystem, React-Router
//     (https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
// 2) Show how an isomorphic / universal app using Redux could look like
// TODO
